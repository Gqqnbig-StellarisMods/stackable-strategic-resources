# Stackable strategic resources

[中文](README.md)

Despite of the number of the same kind of strategic resources you obtained in the game, you can only enjoy a single bonus from this kind. This mod allows effect stacking of the same type of strategic resources. For instance, 7 teldar will generate 105% bonus to kinetic weapon damage.

If you trade out a strategic resources, the mod will automatically adjust the bonus within one month.

At present, strategic resources that are stackable include engos, garanthium, neutronium, satramene, engos, dark matter, and living metal.

Due to technical reasons, the same kind of strategic resources can currently stack up to 8 times.
